# Write your MySQL query statement below
select customer_number from Orders GROUP BY Customer_number 
Order By count(customer_number) DESC LIMIT 1; 

//Note that with oder by clause we cannot use aggregrate functions directly
//Also we say say max(count) it is not directly embedded
//If we say count >1 then there exist multuple record and in that we have to find the maximum which is first 
//in desc order which is written as limit 1
